# docs-devperience

Evaluating a good developer experience for Hedera and Hiero regarding documentation.

The goal of this repo is to find a good split between documentation that is hosted by Hiero and documentation that is hosted by Hedera.

The main entry points are:
- [HIERO DOCS](hiero/sdk/index.md)
- [HEDERA DOCS](hedera/sdks/index.md)

Whenever a link in a file moves to a different host (like from Hedera documentation to Hiero documentation or any other external side) it is marked by :arrow_upper_right: to highlight a switch of the page.
